# Arithmetic-Calculator-using-Python 
This project is a simple yet interactive Command-Line Calculator application built using Python. The calculator allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The primary focus of this project is to demonstrate the use of functions, user input validation, and proper code organization in Python.

Features
Addition: Adds two numbers.
Subtraction: Subtracts one number from another.
Multiplication: Multiplies two numbers.
Division: Divides one number by another with error handling for division by zero.
Interactive User Interface: Command-line interface that prompts the user to select operations and input values.
Input Validation: Ensures valid number inputs, preventing crashes from invalid entries.
Project Structure
Function-Based Design: Each arithmetic operation is implemented as a separate function for better modularity.
Input Validation: The program handles incorrect inputs gracefully, repeatedly prompting the user until valid input is provided.
Error Handling: Division by zero is handled with an appropriate error message, preventing runtime errors.
